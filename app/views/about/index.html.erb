    <p>Currently, Malhi Supermarket operates as a physical store where customers can visit and purchase groceries in person. But now they are looking forward to dive into online business as well by having an e-commerce site where customers can purchase the grocery products online. The aim of the website would be to make shopping easier and more accessible for the customers. The e-commerce site will primarily focus on offering a diverse range of food items, including spices, grains, lentils, condiments, snacks, and beverages.</p>

    <p>The target demographic for the online store includes the Indian community residing in Winnipeg and surrounding areas.
